            <h2>Difference between AI an ML</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are two very important terms in the field of computer science. However, they are often used interchangeably, which can lead to some confusion. Here's a simple explanation of the two:
                
                Artificial Intelligence (AI): This is a broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider "smart" or "intelligent". AI is a discipline in computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.
                
                Machine Learning (ML): This is a subset of AI. It's a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It's a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. In other words, ML is a type of AI that allows a system to learn from data rather than through explicit programming.
                
                So, in summary, AI is the broader concept, and ML is a subset of AI that focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.</p>
